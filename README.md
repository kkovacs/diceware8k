# diceware8k

Simple tool to generate secure passwords offline from the diceware8k word list.

The word list is at: http://world.std.com/~reinhold/dicewarefaq.html#diceware8k

If you **have Go installed**, run it with:

	go run diceware8k.go <number-of-words>
	
Where <number-of-words> is optional and defaults to six, as recommended by Mr. Reinhold at http://world.std.com/~reinhold/dicewarefaq.html#howlong

If you **don't have Go installed**, you can download the standalone binaries -- given that you trust both me and Github ;)
